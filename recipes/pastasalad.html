    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Score the side of a wheel of brie all the way around with a sharp paring knife. Cut directly on the "equator" through the rind. Using a long piece of string or dental floss, wrap the string around the brie on the newly made cut. Loop one end of the string over the other (a half knot). Then pulling the ends of the string in opposite directions, cut the brie in half.</p>
    <p>Press the dried cranberries on one cut side of the brie, and the walnuts on the other. Quickly put the 2 sides back together with the cranberries on top of the walnuts. Press together and stuff back in any cranberries or walnuts that fell out.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound tri-colored spiral pasta</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons salad seasoning mix</li>
        <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>Â½ yellow bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (2.25 ounce) can black olives, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes; rinse under cold water and drain.</li>
        <li>Whisk Italian dressing and salad spice mix together until smooth.</li>
        <li>Combine pasta, tomatoes, bell peppers, and olives in a salad bowl; pour dressing over salad and toss to coat. Refrigerate salad, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    </ol>
