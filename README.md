My First Odin Project

Hello World !
Welcome to my first Odin project after completing some HTML elements and tags. In the Foundation Odin project, I learned about the following :

1. Installing Vscode (windows, MacOs and Linux). I'm actually working on Linux (Ubuntu)
2. Basics of Git and GitHub. Here I learned about how to create my account on GitHub, create a repository in GitHub, linking my Git and GitHub via SSH and cloning the repository into my local machine. I also learned what was the "working tree", "Staged area" and "Git directory online"
3. I also learned about various HTML tags and some best practices on using "strong" vs "b" and "em" vs "i" (). To make it short, it's all about accessibility. 
4. Finally, I learned how to practically check my git status, add my changes to the staged area and then commit (git commit -m ""). As a little bonus cosing everything with a git push to my GitHub.

To make my website available on GitHub, I learned how to configure my GitHub for public access to my web projects.
